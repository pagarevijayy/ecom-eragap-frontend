# Ecom frontend

- production branch for clients can be the latest master
- the drawback of using angular as an ecom platform is that it offers no SEO being a SPA
- prefer next.js solution for SEO in ecom v2

### Project dependencies that need to change as per client basis

1. inbrowser data change (in assets folder)
2. environment variables
